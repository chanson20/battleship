Python Battle Ship
# Made By
Cooper Hanson
# Start
Run batl.py <br />you can change it to battleship.py if you want to
# Rules
You get 5 turns to hit someone elses ship and sink it <br />
pretty simple <br />
If you guess the same spot twice you lose two turns and if you hit any civilians (off the map) you lose 3 turns <br />
If you put in anything that cannot be converted to an integer the program will fail atm (WIP) <br />
