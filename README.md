# battleship
Python Battle Ship
# Made By
Cooper Hanson
# Start
Run batl.py, you can change it to battleship.py if you want to
# Rules
You get 5 turns to hit someone elses ship and sink it
pretty simple
If you guess the same spot twice you lose two turns and if you hit any civilians (off the map) you lose 3 turns
If you put in anything that cannot be converted to an integer the program will fail atm (WIP)
